Sample data is located in the folder "EtA1000_away", with each subfolder corresponding to
each behavioral experiment collected using the animal behavioral tracking tool PiVR. 

The script ExtractTrajectoriesFromImage.py iterates through the sample data folder and extracts
the arena position and odor source locations for each experiment.
